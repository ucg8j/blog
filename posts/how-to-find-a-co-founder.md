excerpt: Having found a co-founder twice. I formed a process that worked for me. Here is how I did it.

I recently went on the hunt for a new co-founder.  This ended up being my process.

# Starting principles
- Run as many as you can in parallel - this is just like any other pipeline, you wouldn't only be talking to customer at a time for a sales pipeline, nor should you for founders.
- Give yourself a deadline, goal setting matters, it also creates urgency so you can close.
- It takes longer than you think, several months for me.
- Decide on some initial parameters
	- Geography: Initially for me, this was East coast US to Europe for some timezone overlap. This became UK+ western Europe. I realised having the Atlantic ocean between us was going too big of a hurdle to derisk the relationship.
	- Profile: I started with 'either a CEO or CTO type'. Typically you'll have a CEO/CTO combo. Being technical myself, I narrowed this to CEO.
	- Idea or not: I was looking for someone with an idea, validated ideally.
	- Quit their job: candidates that haven't don't have the same urgency. They are comfortable and maybe flirting with the idea of startups rather than being ready to commit now.
	- Not an existing duo: you want to be on as equal terms with your co-founder(s) as possible. After meeting with a few, I quickly ruled them out realising it was unlikely I would feel on the same level as the original duo.

# The process
This is somewhere between dating and hiring someone. You want to keep it natural and a lot of it is about getting to know the other person. But you have a deadline and a business objective!

### Top of funnel - get swiping
In dating the 'old way' was being set up by friends. The 'new way' is dating apps. Both work for co-founder leads, but just like apps like Tinder, you'll get many more leads through [Y Combinator's co-founder matching app](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching/).

### 1. The first date
This is the Initial meet and greet. These would be a 30min or a quick in person coffee. The goals:
	-[ ] get to know them
		-[ ] Do you vibe? Yep it's a lot about vibes. If you don't vibe on a first date with someone, you don't go on a second date.
		-[ ] Do you respect them? This is really about whether you see them on eye level.

### 2.  The written assignment
The aim here is to have the most time efficient process to get to know your potential co-founder. The questions get you to introspect on why you're founding a company, get's you to reveal your areas of expertise and thorny questions like how you would resolve a stalemate. The best founders were already aware of the 50 Founder Questions. If someone hadn't heard of them, I'd give them time to get back to me. So that we could then exchange them.
-[ ] Exchange [[50 Founder Questions]] - values, expertise and thinking alignment. Meetings have a high time cost to discover the same information.

### 3.  More dates - discuss the Founder Questions
For some, we would reconvene or just exchange an email saying where the alignment gap was already too big. But if you only have minor areas of disagreements or just some question marks it would take several more calls to work through and discuss these.
-[ ] Each meeting is increasing your confidence in each other, to the point you are ready for a work trial
- Work trial
	- if co-founder is committed to an idea, makes sense to get across
	- share [startupschool FAQs](https://www.startupschool.org/faq) with them - aim to pick a trial project to work on together
	- Optional - more qs from [YCs doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L4wY9qRk75K7B5y9_unueE4Tw0YLRarA9vaCTwfwL-4/edit#heading=h.xhucswxvxook)

### 4.  Part time work trial
By this stage you've worked through values, any possible question marks you've had about each other and are ready to test out what it is like to work with each other. I did this with several people at the same time. Using the dating analogy, this is that tricky and tiring phase where you haven't committed to one person yet. You're switching contexts and trying to not mix up details about each person! The work trial can look quite different depending on each person. For example, with one person they hadn't found an idea, so the working together was about making progress through the ideation phase. For another, it was about doing joint discovery calls and validating ideas.

### 5. Commit
This doesn't mean you have incorporated. But from step 4 you need to pick one person to move forward. And hopefully you have a strong sense of who the right person is. Having committed to each other, set yourself ambitious goals that are aligned to each of your primary areas of responsibility. For me that looked like developing a prototype and for my co-founder it was securing design partnerships. If this all goes well, you're already a company, you just need to sign the dotted line. Good luck!

# Other inspiration
- [Whalesync's trial period template](https://whalesync.notion.site/TEMPLATE-Cofounder-Trial-Period-cbc8b29c068c4150b9ccd71f40291f6e) candidates that haven't don't have the same urgency. They are comfortable and frequently flirting with the idea of startups that actually ready to commit now. YMMV.)
- [YCs doc on co-founder matching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXUOP-FcnIE8eNTkKlELkakZ-MLaIvEyIxUlBOLNZPw/edit) most important things:
	1.  someone you enjoy spending time with and get along with. **Would I want to be friends with this person?**
	2. An exceptional person - smart and effective
	3.  **If you have hesitancy towards someone, listen to it.**
	4. **Find people you have things in common with** - shared interests, hobbies
	5. The person is more important than the idea
	- **The median time between when the founders joined the site and when they matched with the person they ultimately ended up working with is 100 days**
- [EF advice](https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/the-co-founder-checklist-2f5be597e887)
	- Both co-founders are technical, or technical with a domain expert
	- Both co-founders are involved in everything
	- No  ‘pity founding’ - we're mates!
	- A co-founder isn’t a ‘must-have’, a generic role that needs to be filled... they are a vital value-add
	- "Each co-founder needs to have a strong relationship with each co-founder. In our experience, in a three this often isn’t the case. Someone is usually making a compromise and although that may seem ok in the short term, this doesn’t lead to harmonious founding teams in the long term."
	- you have, or can quickly acquire the skills needed to build the product you want to build

	- "You haven't seen someone's true colors unless you've worked with them on a startup."
	- "the relationship between founders was more important than ability"
